          "answer": "In the context of patients undergoing potentially cardiotoxic cancer therapy and receiving anthracycline chemotherapy, cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) is a broad term that captures the spectrum of possible presentations and the aetiological link with various cancer therapies, including chemotherapy, targeted agents, immune therapies, and radiation therapy.\n\nSymptomatic CTRCD is defined as follows:\n\n- Very severe: HF requiring inotropic support, mechanical circulatory support, or consideration of transplantation\n- Severe: HF hospitalization\n- Moderate: Need for outpatient intensification of diuretic and HF therapy\n\nAsymptomatic CTRCD, on the other hand, refers to cardiac dysfunction that is detected in patients during surveillance, even if they do not exhibit new cardiac symptoms. Early recognition of asymptomatic CTRCD allows clinicians to incorporate cardioprotective therapy before there is a significant decline in LVEF, which may or may not be reversible, and also decreases the risk of interruptions in cancer therapy, which could otherwise affect patients' survival.\n\nIn the case of anthracycline chemotherapy-related cardiac dysfunction, the diagnosis of CTRCD includes new CV symptoms, new abnormalities in cardiac function, or both. Early detection of asymptomatic CTRCD is crucial, and the preferred technique for detecting and confirming cardiac dysfunction is TTE, including 3D-LVEF and GLS assessment. GLS evaluation is particularly important in patients with low-normal LVEF to confirm or rule out asymptomatic myocardial damage.",

If the QTc interval changes by ≥ 60 ms from baseline, it should not routinely affect treatment decisions if the QTc remains ≤ 500 ms.\n2. If the QTc exceeds 500 ms, consider restarting the culprit QTc-prolonging cancer treatment at a reduced dose, ideally according to each drug recommendation.\n3.

Myocarditis: This is an inflammation of the heart muscle, which can be caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors. Factors associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor-related myocarditis include age, sex, and the type of cancer being treated (Zamami et al., 2019).\n2. Cardiac adverse events: These can include a range of issues such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest (Dolladille et al., 2020).\n3. Atherosclerotic plaque: There is an association between immune checkpoint inhibitors and atherosclerotic plaque, which can increase the risk of cardiovascular events (Drobni et al., 2020).\n4. Cardiotoxicity: This is a broad term that encompasses a range of cardiac issues, including heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest (Rubio-Infante et al., 2021).\n5. Late cardiac adverse events: These can occur months or even years after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (Dolladille et al., 2020).\n6. Cardiac events: These can include heart failure, arrhythmias, and cardiac arrest, and are a risk for patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (D'Souza et al., 2021).\n\nAs for recommended monitoring strategies, the following are suggested:\n\n1. Regular cardiac monitoring: This should include electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms, and cardiac biomarkers such as troponin and natriuretic peptides (Zhang et al., 2021).\n2. Baseline and follow-up ECGs: These can help identify any changes in cardiac function or rhythm (Dolladille et al., 2021).\n3. Echocardiography: This can help assess cardiac function and identify any signs of cardiotoxicity (Dolladille et al., 2021).\n4. Cardiac biomarkers: These can help identify cardiac damage or stress (Zhang et al., 2021).\n5. Regular follow-up: Patients should be followed up regularly to monitor for any signs of cardiac toxicity (Dolladille et al., 2020).\n\nReferences:\n\nDolladille C, Akroun J, Morice P-M, Dompmartin A, Ezine E, Sassier M, et al.

The left panel of Figure 9 describes five different primary or secondary prevention strategies, but it does not explicitly list the indications for primary prevention strategies. However, it mentions that dyslipidaemia, underlying CVD, and modifiable comorbidities should be managed according to the 2021 ESC Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice.\n\nThe right panel of Figure 9 describes general strategies to mitigate CTR-CVT risk in patients at high and very high risk of CTRCD, but it does not provide specific indications for primary prevention strategies.\n\nHowever, based on the general context of cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) and the need to prevent cardiovascular toxicities associated with various cancer treatments, the following primary prevention strategies can be inferred:\n\n1.  **Pre-existing CVD**: Patients with a history of CVD should be managed according to the 2021 ESC Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice.\n2.  **Dyslipidaemia**: Patients with dyslipidaemia should be managed according to the 2021 ESC Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice.\n3.  **Modifiable comorbidities**: Patients with modifiable comorbidities should be managed according to the 2021 ESC Guidelines on CVD prevention in clinical practice.\n\nAs for the medications recommended for each indication, the provided information does not explicitly list specific medications. However, it mentions that ACE-I (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) and ARB (angiotensin receptor blockers) are mentioned in the context of CTR-CVT prevention, but it does not specify their use for primary prevention strategies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is that the indications for primary cardiovascular prevention strategies in cancer patients are based on pre-existing CVD, dyslipidaemia, and modifiable comorbidities, but the specific medications recommended for each indication are not explicitly listed.",

Cardiomyopathy can also be first diagnosed in pregnancy or arise during pregnancy as Peripartum Cardiomyopathy (PPCM). \n\nThe risk associated with pregnancy in a patient with cardiomyopathy is estimated using the modified World Health Organization (mWHO) classification. Pregnancy is contraindicated in women with WHO class IV, including patients with an ejection fraction (EF) less than 30% or New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV symptoms.\n\nManagement strategies for women with cardiomyopathy during pregnancy should be individualized and may involve close monitoring, medication adjustments, and possibly hospitalization. It is essential for these women to be under the care of a cardiologist and an obstetrician experienced in managing high-risk pregnancies.\n\nSpecific considerations and management strategies for different cardiomyopathy subtypes include:\n\n- For women with Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (ARVC), the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death during pregnancy is increased. Close monitoring and possibly implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) may be necessary.\n- For women with Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM), the risk of heart failure and arrhythmias during pregnancy is increased. Close monitoring, medication adjustments, and possibly hospitalization may be necessary.\n- For women with Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM), the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death during pregnancy is increased. Close monitoring and possibly implantation of an ICD may be necessary.\n- For women with Non-Dilated Left Ventricular Cardiomyopathy (NDLVC), the risk of heart failure and arrhythmias during pregnancy is increased. Close monitoring, medication adjustments, and possibly hospitalization may be necessary.\n- For women with Lamin A/C (LMNA) genotype-positive cardiomyopathy, the risk of progression of cardiomyopathy during pregnancy is increased. Close monitoring and possibly medication adjustments may be necessary.\n\nIt is essential for women with cardiomyopathy to discuss their individual risks and management strategies with their healthcare providers before and during pregnancy.",

The SYNTAX score is particularly useful in complex cases and in patients with multivessel disease and diabetes, where recent evidence suggests a greater benefit of CABG over PCI.\n\nIn general, PCI is considered an appropriate alternative to CABG in patients with low-to-intermediate anatomical complexity, including those with left main (LM) disease. However, in patients with high SYNTAX scores, there is a trend towards better survival with CABG.\n\nSpecifically, the indications for CABG over PCI are:\n\n* Patients with an intermediate-to-high SYNTAX score (>22), where the benefit of CABG over PCI is greater.\n* Patients with multivessel disease involving the proximal LAD (Left Anterior Descending artery), where a higher risk of the composite of death, MI, and stroke is reported with PCI compared to CABG.\n* Patients with multivessel disease and diabetes, where recent evidence suggests a greater benefit of CABG over PCI.\n* Patients with high SYNTAX scores, where a trend towards better survival is noted with CABG.\n\nIn contrast, PCI is considered an appropriate alternative to CABG in patients with:\n\n* Low-to-intermediate anatomical complexity, including those with LM disease.\n* Low SYNTAX scores (≤22), where the risk of death is not significantly different between CABG and PCI.\n\nIt is essential to note that the recommendations are based on the current evidence and may be subject to change as new data becomes available.",

          "answer": "Coronary CT angiography (CTA) and functional testing play crucial roles in evaluating patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The appropriate use of these modalities depends on the clinical likelihood of ACS and patient presentation.\n\n**Low-risk patients with normal troponin levels:**\n\n- Coronary CT angiography (CTA) is recommended as a first-line diagnostic tool in low-risk patients with normal high-sensitivity troponin (hs-Tn) levels at presentation. It can help identify or rule out coronary artery disease (CAD) and guide further management.\n- Functional testing, such as stress echocardiography or stress nuclear imaging, may not be necessary in this group, as CTA provides a more direct assessment of coronary anatomy.\n\n**Intermediate-risk patients with elevated troponin levels:**\n\n- In intermediate-risk patients with elevated hs-Tn levels, a combination of hs-Tn and CTCA may be used to further risk stratify patients. CTCA can help identify high-risk plaque features, which are associated with an increased risk of acute coronary events.\n- Functional testing may be considered in this group to assess myocardial perfusion and viability, particularly if CTCA findings are inconclusive or suggest significant stenosis.\n\n**High-risk patients with ST-segment elevation or significant troponin elevation:**\n\n- In high-risk patients with ST-segment elevation or significant troponin elevation, functional testing, such as stress echocardiography or stress nuclear imaging, is often preferred to assess myocardial perfusion and viability.\n- CTCA may be used to identify high-risk plaque features or guide percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in selected cases.\n\n**Key points:**\n\n- A diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) cannot be established based on CTCA alone.\n- CTCA can help reduce subsequent outpatient testing and costs by identifying or ruling out CAD in low-to-intermediate risk patients.\n- Functional testing is essential in high-risk patients to assess myocardial perfusion and viability.\n- The ROMICAT-II trial demonstrated that hs-Tn followed by CTCA improves acute coronary syndrome risk stratification accuracy and workup in acute chest pain patients.\n\nIn summary, the role of coronary CTA and functional testing in evaluating patients with suspected ACS depends on the clinical likelihood of ACS and patient presentation. CTA is recommended as a first-line diagnostic tool in low-risk patients, while functional testing is preferred in high-risk patients.

If not a hypertensive emergency, prompt confirmation (preferably within a week) can be considered prior to commencing treatment.\n5.  **Screening BP of 140–159/90–99 mmHg**: Out-of-office BP measurement should be used to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nIn terms of measurement techniques, the preferred method for confirming cases of elevated BP or hypertension is out-of-office BP measurement, specifically using ABPM or HBPM. Office BP measurement is less desirable due to its lower specificity compared to ABPM for detecting hypertension.",

          ],
          "answer": "The stepwise pharmacological approach to blood pressure management, including drug combinations and sequencing, can be outlined as follows:\n\n1.  **Initial Assessment and Monitoring**: The first step is to assess the patient's blood pressure and monitor their condition. This involves evaluating their medical history, lifestyle, and current medications.\n2.  **Single Pill Combination Therapy**: If the patient's blood pressure is not adequately controlled, a single pill combination therapy can be initiated. This typically involves a combination of two or more medications in a single pill, such as a combination of an ACE inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, and a diuretic.\n3.  **Dual Combination Therapy**: If the single pill combination therapy is not effective, a dual combination therapy can be introduced. This involves adding a second medication to the initial single pill combination, such as adding a beta-blocker or an alpha-blocker.\n4.  **Triple Combination Therapy**: If the dual combination therapy is not effective, a triple combination therapy can be initiated. This involves adding a third medication to the dual combination, such as adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.\n5.  **Quadruple Combination Therapy**: If the triple combination therapy is not effective, a quadruple combination therapy can be considered. This involves adding a fourth medication to the triple combination, such as adding a direct renin inhibitor.\n\nIt's worth noting that the decision to move from one step to the next should be based on the patient's individual response to treatment and their overall health status. The goal is to find the most effective and tolerable combination of medications that can help achieve blood pressure control while minimizing side effects.\n\nThe algorithm in Figure 18, as mentioned in the ESC Guidelines, provides a practical approach to pharmacological blood pressure lowering, including considerations around single-pill combinations. The algorithm aims to introduce a low-dose double and then triple-combination strategy while monitoring tolerance.\n\nReferences:\n\n*   ESC Guidelines 3960\n*   ESC Guidelines 3961\n*   Zhang ZY, Yu YL, Asayama K, Hansen TW, Maestre GE, Staessen JA.

          "answer": "Resistant hypertension is defined as blood pressure (BP) remaining above goal despite three or more BP-lowering drugs of different classes at maximally tolerated doses, of which one is a diuretic. It is not a disease per se, but rather a condition where patients have a worse prognosis, with a higher risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, end-stage renal disease, and death.\n\nManagement of resistant hypertension involves both non-pharmacological and pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological interventions include lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise, which have been shown to reduce BP in patients with resistant hypertension. Pharmacological interventions include the use of single-pill combinations to reduce the pill burden and increase drug adherence and persistence.\n\nIt is essential to exclude pseudo-resistance, which is often caused by poor adherence to BP-lowering treatment, and secondary causes of hypertension. This can be done by verifying adherence through careful questioning of the patient, objective evaluation of adherence, and excluding white-coat hypertension. The work-up of patients with resistant hypertension is complex and often requires specialized centers with expertise and resources.",

          "answer": "According to the 2024 guidelines, the approach to blood pressure management in frail elderly patients should prioritize personalized decision making. Very old and frail patients with hypertension should not be denied the potential benefits of blood pressure-lowering treatment, with a target of 120–129/70–79 mmHg. However, a major consideration should also be whether reversible causes of frailty can be addressed, such as treating underlying comorbidities or undergoing supervised muscle-strengthening physiotherapy or supervised exercise and coordination and balance training.\n\nBefore starting blood pressure-lowering treatment, all patients must be fully informed about the benefits and risks, so that their preference is considered. In the case of frail and/or older patients, 18 out of 34 hypertension guidelines recommended a systolic goal of 150 mmHg.\n\nThe guidelines also suggest that frailty should be assessed, and the HYpertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) study is a relevant reference in this context. The study found that antihypertensives can be beneficial for people with hypertension aged 80 and over.\n\nIn terms of assessment tools, frailty can be assessed using various methods, such as the Council for Cardiology Practice (CCP) consensus document, which provides a definition, assessment, and clinical implications for general cardiology. Additionally, the Association for Acute Cardio Vascular Care (ACVC) and the Association of Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions (ACNAP) may also provide relevant information.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the association between blood pressure and mortality in older adults may be different with frailty, as suggested by a systematic review and meta-analysis published in Age and Ageing.",

          "answer": "Managing aortic diseases in patients with genetic syndromes like Marfan requires a multidisciplinary team approach with integration of clinical and genetic findings. The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is based on the Ghent criteria, with aortic root aneurysm/dissection and ectopia lentis as cardinal features. Gene panel testing is meaningful for confirmation of the diagnosis and to guide management. \n\nSpecifically, echocardiographic assessment of the aortic root should include measurements at the annulus, sinus, sinotubyl junction, distal ascending, arch, and descending thoracic aortic levels, corrected for the individual's age, sex, and body surface area. \n\nProphylactic surgery can prevent aortic dissection and rupture, and early identification and establishment of the correct diagnosis is critical. Presymptomatic genetic screening of family members is also mandatory to allow early and appropriate management once a pathogenic variant is identified.",

However, the study also noted that the quality of evidence was generally low due to the small sample sizes and heterogeneity among the included studies.\n\nAnother systematic review and meta-analysis by Santangeli et al. (2019) compared the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic drugs and catheter ablation for the prevention of recurrent ventricular tachycardia in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. The study found that catheter ablation was associated with a lower risk of recurrent ventricular tachycardia and a higher rate of arrhythmia-free survival compared to antiarrhythmic drugs.\n\nIn contrast, a systematic review and meta-analysis by Martinez et al.

          "answer": "The approach to risk stratification and prevention of sudden cardiac death in athletes involves a multifaceted strategy that incorporates screening, management, and education. \n\nScreening for cardiomyopathies and other cardiac conditions that may predispose athletes to sudden cardiac death is crucial. According to Corrado et al. (1122), screening for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in young athletes is essential, as it is a common cause of sudden cardiac death in this population. The American Heart Association recommends screening for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in young athletes, particularly those participating in high-risk sports.\n\nThe European Society of Cardiology recommends a comprehensive pre-participation screening program for athletes, which includes a medical history, physical examination, and electrocardiogram (ECG) (Corrado et al., 2012). The ECG is a valuable tool in identifying athletes at risk of sudden cardiac death, as it can detect abnormalities such as QT interval prolongation, which is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (Albert et al., 2000).\n\nIn addition to screening, management of cardiomyopathies and other cardiac conditions is critical. The American Heart Association recommends that athletes with a history of cardiomyopathy or other cardiac conditions be evaluated by a cardiologist and receive appropriate treatment and management (Maron et al., 2009).\n\nThe risk of sudden cardiac death in athletes can also be reduced through education and awareness. Athletes, coaches, and parents should be educated about the risks of sudden cardiac death and the importance of seeking medical attention if symptoms occur (Corrado et al., 2012).\n\nIn terms of specific recommendations for screening and management, the European Society of Cardiology recommends the following:\n\n* A comprehensive pre-participation screening program for all athletes, including a medical history, physical examination, and ECG\n* Screening for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in young athletes\n* Evaluation and management of athletes with a history of cardiomyopathy or other cardiac conditions by a cardiologist\n* Education and awareness about the risks of sudden cardiac death and the importance of seeking medical attention if symptoms occur\n\nOverall, the approach to risk stratification and prevention of sudden cardiac death in athletes requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted strategy that incorporates screening, management, and education.\n\nReferences:\nAlbert CM, Mittleman MA, Chae CU, Lee IM, Hennekens CH, Manson JE.

          "answer": "Genetic testing plays a significant role in the investigation of sudden cardiac death (SCD) victims and their families. According to the expert consensus statement by APHRS/HRS, genetic testing is recommended for autopsy-negative SCD cases, particularly in young individuals, to identify potential genetic causes of arrhythmias and cardiac disease.\n\nStudies have shown that genetic testing can be beneficial in identifying inheritable heart disease in families affected by SCD. For instance, a study by Behr et al. (2008) found that familial evaluation identified inheritable heart disease in the majority of families with SCD. Another study by Kumar et al. (2013) found that targeted genetic evaluation had a low yield in SCD cases but a high yield in unexplained cardiac arrest syndromes.\n\nThe European recommendations for genetic testing in SCD cases suggest integrating genetic testing into multidisciplinary management, as proposed by Fellmann et al. (2019). This approach involves a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's medical history, family history, and genetic testing to identify potential genetic causes of SCD.\n\nIn terms of family screening approaches, whole exome sequencing with gene-specific analysis has been shown to be effective in identifying genetic causes of SCD in young individuals, as demonstrated by a case series study (Pediatr Cardiol, 2015). However, the yield of postmortem genetic testing in SCD cases with structural findings at autopsy is relatively low, as reported by Lahrouchi et al. (2020).\n\nOverall, genetic testing is an essential tool in the investigation of SCD victims and their families, and a comprehensive approach that includes genetic testing, family history evaluation, and multidisciplinary management is recommended to identify potential genetic causes of SCD and prevent future events.",

Restarting the culprit QTc-prolonging cancer treatment may be considered, ideally at a reduced dose according to each drug recommendation.\n4. Weekly ECG monitoring during the first 4–6 weeks and then monthly thereafter is recommended in patients with cancer after restarting QTc-prolonging cancer therapy.\n5. Discontinuation of QTc-prolonging cancer therapy is recommended in patients who develop TdP or sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias during treatment.\n\nFor patients with long QT syndrome, the management strategies include:\n\n1. Avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs.\n2. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation, particularly when life expectancy is >1 year.\n3. Isoprenaline infusion or temporary pacing in patients with QTc prolongation associated with severe bradycardia or sinus pauses.\n\nFor patients on antiarrhythmic drugs for ventricular arrhythmias, the management strategies include:\n\n1. Avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs.\n2. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation, particularly when life expectancy is >1 year.\n3. Monitoring for QT prolongation and arrhythmias, and discontinuation of the offending drug if QT prolongation occurs.",

          "answer": "Cardiac MRI plays a significant role in diagnosing and monitoring various cardiovascular conditions, including cardiomyopathies, chronic coronary syndromes with INOCA (Ischemia with No Obvious Coronary Artery disease), and cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction. \n\nIn the context of cardiomyopathies, cardiac MRI is a valuable diagnostic tool for assessing the structure and function of the heart. Studies such as Masso et al. (2020) and Grothoff et al. (2012) have highlighted the importance of cardiac MRI in detecting left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy and differentiating it from other cardiomyopathies. Cardiac MRI can provide detailed images of the heart's anatomy and function, allowing for accurate diagnosis and monitoring of cardiomyopathies.\n\nFor chronic coronary syndromes with INOCA, cardiac MRI can help identify areas of myocardial ischemia and infarction, even in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. This is particularly useful for patients with non-obstructive coronary artery disease, where cardiac MRI can provide valuable information on myocardial perfusion and viability.\n\nIn cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction, cardiac MRI can assess the impact of cancer treatment on the heart, including cardiotoxicity and cardiac damage. This can help clinicians monitor the effects of treatment and make informed decisions about further management.\n\nOverall, cardiac MRI is a powerful tool for diagnosing and monitoring various cardiovascular conditions, offering valuable insights into the structure and function of the heart. Its non-invasive nature and high sensitivity make it an essential diagnostic tool in the management of cardiomyopathies, chronic coronary syndromes with INOCA, and cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction.",
